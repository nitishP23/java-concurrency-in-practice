# java-concurrency-in-practice
My notes on java-concurrency-in-practice book.
- This contains my notes which i have been preparing while reading java-concurrency-in-practice.
- It is an awesome book, however when i was a beginner i tried reading this and i could not understand it 
  as the examples were a little hard to understand & the book itself had too much information.
- So now since i have achieved a little bit expertise in java, i would like to complete the book (as i love to study
  about multithreading).
- I am also posting this notes, so that my friends & my colleagues can understand the concepts of multi-threading
  java clearly & as an added advantage they may atleast feel like they have read the book :)
