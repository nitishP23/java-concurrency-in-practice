-> Writing thread-safe code is all about managing access to state of an object i.e in particular shared, mutable states.
   1.Shared  : means that variable can be accessed by multiple threads.
   2.Mutable : means that variable can be changed during its lifetime.  

-> An object is basically composed of state (instance or static fields) & behaviour (means methods).  
  
-> An object's state is its data, stored in state variables such as instance or static fields.
   E.g.:-
    public class ThreadSafety {
	   //A instance field, which is the state of this object.
	   private int counter = 0;  
	   
	   public void increment() {
	       count++;
	   }
	   
	   public void get() {
		   return count;		   
	   }
	}
	
-> Thread safety is all about protecting data from uncontrolled access. 

-> Making an object "thread safe" requires synchronization to coordinate access to the
   state variables, failing to do so can cause data corruption leading to undesirable
   consequences.
  
-> If multiple threads access a state variable & if one of them might write into it, then 
   we need to coordinate access to the variable using "Synchronization".
  
-> "Synchronization" in java is primarely provided by the synchronization keyword, but the "Synchronization"
   also means using "volatile" variables, explicit locks, and atomic variables.

=> KEY-NOTE: 
  -> If multiple threads access a mutable state variable without appropriate "Synchronization", then the program is 
     broken, there are 3 ways to avoid it.
	 1. Don't share the state variables.
	 2. Make the state variable immutable.
	 3. Use Synchronization whenever accessing the state variable.

-> How to implement thread safety is a very common questions, however the concepts of OOPS such as encapsulation & 
   data-hiding can help us create thread-safety classes.
  
-> Java language does not enforce to encapsulate state (i.e instance or static fields), it is pretty ok to
   make your state variables "public" or publish (share) you reference to other object.However the better 
   encapsulated your program state, the easier it is to make your program thread safe and maintainable.  
   For E.g.:-   
      public class UnsafeCounter {
        //This variable can be accessed by the owning object.
        public int count;
	  
        public void increment() {
	      count++;
	    }
      }
  
      public class SafeCounter {
        //State variable is hidden, can only be accessed from methods.
	    private int count;
	  
	    /* 
	     Accessing or changing the state variable are done 
	     in a synchronized way.
	    */
	    public synchronized increment(){
		  count++;
	    }
	  
	    public synchronized get(){
		  return count;
	    }
      }
   
=> KEY-NOTE:
  -> When designing thread-safe classes, good OOP techniques - encapsulation, immutability & clear specification 
    of invariants (what can change & what does not change) - are your best friends.
  
=> KEY-NOTE:
  -> Good practice : First make your code right, and then make it fast.
  
-> Difference between thread-safe-class & thread-safe-program:
  -> A program that entirely contain thread-safe-classes may not be a thread-safe-program.
  -> A thread-safe-program may contain classes that are not thread-safe.

-> Thread-safety may be a term that is applied to code, but it is about state, and it can only be applied to 
   the entire body of code that encapsulates it state, which may be an object or an entire program.
